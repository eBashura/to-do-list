This project is a to-do-list application created using the Django framework for python. The todo-list supports multiple users, and allows new users to register and login with a username and password. Pages for each user are inaccessible without that user being signed in, so the to-do-list data for each user is private.

The project uses a MySQL database with Django for the backend, then Django's template engine for the frontend

Docker and docker-compose must be installed to run this application.

Start the project with:

> docker-compose build

> docker-compose up
